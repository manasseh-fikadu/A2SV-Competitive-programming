### Problems <a href="#problems" id="problems"></a>

Choose one of the three provided problems. The outcomes are usually better if the problem that you are working on is interesting for you. This way you will come up with more ideas, what can be explored and analyzed.

**COVID-19 crisis**

The world is still struggling with one of the most rapidly spreading pandemics. There are a lot of people who say that data is the best weapon we can use in this "Corona Fight."

Imagine that you are one of the best data scientists in your country. The president of your country asked you to analyze the COVID-19 patient-level data of South Korea and prepare your homeland for the next wave of the pandemic. You, as the lead data scientist of your country **have to create and prove a plan of fighting the pandemics in your country** by analyzing the provided data. You must get the most critical insights using learned data science techniques and present them to the lead of your country.

The link to the [Kaggle dataset is here](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset/).

**2016 US presidential elections**

In 2016, Donald Trump lost the popular vote, yet he won the electoral vote, securing four years in the Oval Office. This has been a shock to Democratic supporters all around the world.

Imagine you travel back in time to 2016. As soon as you step out of your time capsule, the Democratic Party hires you. They want you, the best data scientist across time and space, **to explain what happened and what should have been done differently**. They want you to **prepare them for the 2020 presidential elections**.

The Party has some tips for you - inspect the voters. What are Trump supporters? What do they feature? What are our supporters? Where should focus next? Any pro-Trump states? Cities?

The Democrats were kind enough to share [a Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election) with you on the 2016 U.S. elections. Use the data to help the Democrats.

**Fatal Police Shooting in the United States**

[Police brutality in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police\_brutality\_in\_the\_United\_States) has been a national issue since the 20th century. The public safety of U.S. citizens is a typical argument to justify the controversially high number of fatal shootings.

You are a contractor to the United States Department of Justice. **You have been given a case to investigate fatal police shootings throughout the United States of America, provide a list of issues, and propose a plan on how to tackle these issues**.

The department offered some tips - the public opinion indicates that there's something systematically fishy about the police actions against civilians. We also know that some states differ from the others, some cities are different from others, race equality is still an unanswered question. There's also some talk about huge spendings on police, rumors about mental issues of those getting shot. Government is all about prioritizing - use the data to list issues with the police activity and propose a plan which issues to tackle first and how.

You are given one dataset to start with. Try to search for more datasets to enrich your data analysis.

Here's the dataset: [Fatal Police Shootings in the U.S. '15 - '17](https://www.kaggle.com/washingtonpost/police-shootings).

### Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* Perform data cleaning and feature engineering. Work with features - handle missing data if needed, use Pandas date APIs, create other additional features.
* Perform exploratory data analysis. Describe the data with basic statistical parameters - mean, median, quantiles, etc. Use parameters that give you the most important statistical insights of the data. Grouping the data and analyzing the groups - using Pandas aggregate methods. Visualize the data - you can use line, scatter, histogram plots, density plots, regplots, etc.
* Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.
* Present the project - the data, methods, and results.
* Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.
