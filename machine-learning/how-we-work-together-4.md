# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» Project - Supervised Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* Download the data from [Travel Insurance Prediction Data](https://www.kaggle.com/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data).
* Perform exploratory data analysis. This should include creating statistical summaries and charts, testing for anomalies, checking for correlations and other relations between variables, and other EDA elements.
* Perform statistical inference. This should include defining the target population, forming multiple statistical hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals, setting the significance levels, conducting z or t-tests for these hypotheses.
* Apply various machine learning models to predict the TravelInsurance column using the other features. This should include hyperparameter tuning, model ensembling, the analysis of model selection, and other methods.
* Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.
* Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.
