_Additional note:_ As a data scientist you will probably not be required to manage your company's production environment (but I've heard about some exceptions). This short course specifically teaches you how to use Docker for develpoment. These skills will be extremely useful if you'll do some experimentation with less mature libraries and frameworks, which only 'play nice' with a very limited number of development environments.
