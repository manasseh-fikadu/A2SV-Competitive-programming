### Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* Download the data from [Podcast Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews/versions/28).
* Load the data using SQLite and Pandas.
* Perform exploratory data analysis. This should include creating statistical summaries and charts, testing for anomalies, checking for correlations and other relations between variables, and other EDA elements.
* Perform statistical inference. This should include defining the target population, forming multiple statistical hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals, setting the significance levels, and conducting z or t-tests for these hypotheses.
* Create a Google Data Studio dashboard with at least three different types of charts.
* Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.
* Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.
