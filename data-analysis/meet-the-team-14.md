### Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

* Download the data from [Red Wine Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).
* Load the data using Pandas.
* Perform exploratory data analysis. This should include creating statistical summaries and charts, testing for anomalies, checking for correlations and other relations between variables, and other EDA elements.
* Perform statistical inference. This should include defining the target population, forming multiple statistical hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals, setting the significance levels, conducting z or t-tests for these hypotheses.
* Apply linear machine learning models to predict the quality column using the other 11 features. This should include the analysis of model selection using the statistical significance of each feature, R-squared, at least one popular information criteria, and other methods.
* Apply linear machine learning models to predict the alcohol column using the other 11 features. This should include the analysis of model selection using the statistical significance of each feature, R-squared, at least one popular information criteria, and other methods.
* Create a Google Data Studio dashboard with at least three different types of charts.
* Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.
* Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.
